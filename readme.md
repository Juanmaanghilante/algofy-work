You can access the page by running `npm test` and visiting `localhost:3000`. My page is divided into three sections: `hero`, `contact`, and `about`.

- The three `<a>` links in the header redirect you, using EJS, to other views where you can explore my skills and find a login form.
- All views are designed to be responsive and display well on mobile devices, such as the iPhone 12.

Thank you for this opportunity. I am confident that my knowledge can be of great assistance to Algofy.
